# Atlantic-MW2
An open-source Modern Warfare 2 mod menu for the PS3. This project is old and will no longer be updated unless I feel like working on it again.

# Why I Started This Project
I started working off of the Zircon SPRX project because I wanted to improve the menu. I did not plan on fully rewriting its code, I simply wanted to improve upon what was already there. The Atlantic update simply cleans up the visual GUI of the menu. I have made some other small changes to improve the quality of life of the menu. Other than that, it's mostly the same as the original Zircon project. I do not take credit for the original menu. I only take credit for the changes that I made to the menu. This is why I have decided to rename the menu to something new. Overall, I intended to mainly use this project to learn about how C++ works and also just get an idea/understanding of how PS3 SPRXs work. 

# Compiling The SPRX
Simply use the PS3 4.75 SDK along with an older version of Visual Studio to compile this project.
